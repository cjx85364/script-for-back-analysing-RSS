# script-for-back-analysing-RSS
this script contain three .py files and two jupyter notebooks

to run this code, people should put all files in same folder 

the "test_cov" file is used to test a specific cov for cohesion that best macth unfailed hillslope during earthquake

people can run "test best cov.ipynb" file to carry out this step. In this notebook, we use a simple case to quick show how to run it.

the "co_seismic_simulation" is used to back-analyses for shear strenght of coseismic phase that the post-seismic landslide stable during earthquake

the "post_seismic_simulation" is used to back-analyses for shear strenght of post-seismic phase that the post-seismic landslide failed

people can run "test best cov.ipynb" file to carry out this step and calculate the RSS.
